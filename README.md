# Vim-IDE

This is my Vim configuration.

To install launch `install.sh` script with root permissions.

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

This one install [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Cscope](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/) if required and copy config files to `$HOME/.vim` directory.

To define directory to install you can use `-d` or `--directory`. For example:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh -d ./custom/directory
```
